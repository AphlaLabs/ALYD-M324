# ALYD-M324
The M324 is one of ALMD's first projects to get to the prototyping phase. This however is the Digital version for testing the concept.
The M324 is an enciphering machine that is similar to the WW2 german Lorenz cipher in it's operation. It uses a Vernam cipher at it's core but has some signifcant changes to it's design. The M324 has 4 enciphering stages instead of just 2, It uses 8 bit ASCII instead of 5 bit Baudot, it uses a different method of advancing the code wheels and it will eventully, when its finished, be able to connect to a computer.
This computer program version was coded entirely on an old 386 era computer running dos 5.00 using microsoft QBasic. However it does work on modern computers with the use of a QBasic interpter like QB64.
I used this program to get used to QBasic and it is my first QBasic program so it's not very well coded, but hey it works.
